## Code conventions

We have ESLint to check for style in the JavaScript and .vue files. Before you commit, please run a check and auto-fix before submitting a pull-request.

We use [AirBnB's JavaScript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to keep the codebase all in one cohesive format. Having an editor like Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will help check for ESLint mistakes as you write code. It is highly recommended.

We also use stylelint to lint the Sass code inside the `.vue` components, so please make sure to check the Git log for any Git failures.

## Where is the database? Website?

When you develop locally, a test account is pre-loaded in the game so you do not need to set up the Laravel mumbo-jumbo and database and get off to a quicker start.

Of course, this comes with limitations like no saving a player's save file and only you can be logged in because we are mocking the player object.

You can easily download the `website` repo and make authentic connections to your local database. But the default option is local players are loaded.

### Contribution Tools
We are in the process of adding these tools to help make the process of contributing and in general easier in the future.

- Sass Style checking (CSS)
- Commit checks. Check for style issues before commiting.
- Unit tests within Vue components
